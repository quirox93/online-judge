    "Como funcionaria este efecto:\n<Armor Purge> (When this Digimon would be deleted, you may trash the top card of this Digimon to prevent that deletion.)",
  answer:
    "De acuerdo con la Regla 4 y la Regla 3, el efecto <Armor Purge> (When this Digimon would be deleted, you may trash the top card of this Digimon to prevent that deletion.) se activaría inmediatamente antes de que el Digimon esté a punto de ser eliminado, pero antes de que realmente suceda. \n\nEste efecto interrumpe la acción que sirve como su condición de activación, en este caso, la eliminación del Digimon. Entonces, puedes elegir descartar la carta superior de este Digimon para prevenir esa eliminación. \n\nSi este efecto se ha activado una vez durante un conjunto de efectos derivados de la activación de un solo efecto, no se activará de nuevo durante la activación de cualquier efecto derivado siguiente, incluso si se cumple la condición de activación. Solo puede ser activado de nuevo una vez que todos los efectos derivados hayan sido activados.",
